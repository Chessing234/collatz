# Collatz research frontier

Persistent checkpoint. Update at every synthesis round. Status codes:
**PROVED** = Lean kernel-checked. **TESTED** = finite computation only, never a proof.
**CONJ** = conjectural. **REFUTED** = killed, with counterexample. **CLOSED** = provably
unreachable by the stated method.

## The reduction (PROVED)

`NeverDrops x := ∀ j, x ≤ T^j(x)` where `T(n) = n/2` (even), `(3n+1)/2` (odd).

**Collatz ⟺ 1 is the only number that never drops.** (`NeverDrops.collatz_iff_neverDrops`)
Needed the bridge `accReachesOne_of_orbit` (standard reachability ⇒ accelerated).

## The two mirror theorems (PROVED) — the core of the whole development

In the shifted coordinate `u = x + 1`:
- an **odd step** multiplies `u` by `3/2`;
- a **backward odd step** `p(v) = (2v−1)/3` multiplies `u` by `2/3`.

| | forward | backward |
|---|---|---|
| run of length `j` available iff | `2^j ∣ (x+1)` | `3^j ∣ (v+1)` |
| exact identity | `2^j (T^j x + 1) = 3^j (x+1)` | `3^j (p^j v + 1) = 2^j (v+1)` |
| rationed by | `2^j ≤ x+1` | (see master bound) |

`OddRuns.oddRun_iff`, `RunValue.oddRun_value`, `BackwardRun.exists_backChain`.
Each direction is governed by the valuation of `u` at the *opposite* prime.

## Least never-dropper `m` — the profile (PROVED)

- `m ≥ 307200` (verified range, 300 blocks of the mod-1024 sieve)
- `m` odd, `m ≡ 3 (mod 4)`, `m mod 16 ∈ {7,11,15}`
- `m ≢ 2 (mod 3)`, `m ≢ 4 (mod 9)`, so `m ≡ 3 or 7 (mod 12)`
- heavy at every scale; `2^(v+W) ≤ 3^v` and `W < v` on the first excursion
- `T(m) = (3m+1)/2`, `T²(m) = (9m+5)/4` exactly

## MASTER BOUND (PROVED) — strongest single statement

`BackwardRun.orbit_backward_bound`: for every orbit point `v = T^i(m)` and every `j`,

    3^j ∣ (v+1)  ⟹  3^j (m+1) ≤ 2^j (v+1)      i.e.  v+1 ≥ (3/2)^j (m+1)

Contrapositive (`no_low_backward_run`): **no orbit point below `(3/2)^j (m+1)` is
`−1 mod 3^j`.** Subsumes the whole ad-hoc descent ladder (`j=1,i=0` gives `m ≢ 2 mod 3`).
Sharp: bounds attained exactly at `T(m)`, `T²(m)`.

## Obstructions (PROVED / CLOSED)

1. **CLOSED — mod-3 descent.** `3 ∣ v` ⟹ `v` has exactly one preimage, `2v`
   (`ThreeObstruction.pred_unique_of_three_dvd`). Backward tree of a multiple of 3 is a
   single doubling chain, so backward descent can *never* reach `3 ∣ m`, at any word
   length, any modulus. Matches computation: all `3^(K−1)` such classes survive at every `3^K`.
   BUT: excluded for cycles (`neverDrops_cycle_not_three_dvd`).
2. **CLOSED — cycle summation.** Multiplying excursion identities round a cycle telescopes
   to `2^L > 3^a`, so the local bound `2^(v+W) ≤ 3^v` provably fails somewhere; no
   summation argument of that shape exists (`Frontier.targetC_no_summation`).
3. **REFUTED — single-excursion criterion.** `102411` has no contracting first excursion
   (`Frontier.targetD_hypothesis_false`). One excursion never suffices.
4. **CLOSED — sieve density.** Survivor counts 3,8,19,64,226,734,2114,7495,27328 at levels
   4..20: density falls but **count rises**. Survivors form a coherent tower = the 2-adic
   integer `−1` (`SieveDensity.coherent_tower`).
5. **CEILING — density rate.** Rate `p/q` needs `3^p < 2^q`; capped by `log2/log3`.
   Best `41/65`; decay ceiling `0.96863^k`; `17/27` already within 0.1% of it.

## Surviving case space

- `m ≡ 2 (mod 3)`: **closed** (descent).
- `m ≡ 0 (mod 3)`: backward descent **provably cannot** reach it; closed only for cycles.
- `m ≡ 1 (mod 3)`: partially closed. Survivor fraction of `≡1 mod 3` classes at `3^k`:
  0.6296 (81), 0.6296 (243), 0.6214 (729), 0.6104 (2187). Slowly decreasing — TESTED only.
- Cycle half reduces to bounding `|2^L − 3^a|` below: linear forms in logarithms (Baker).
  Not elementary; outside Lean-core reach.

## Highest-value open directions

1. Push the master bound: for which `i` is `v3(T^i(m)+1)` large? Combine with forward
   structure to force a contradiction.
2. Joint mod-`2^a·3^b` sieve — is any joint survivor set empty?
3. `≡1 mod 3`: explain the surviving fraction; does it → 0?
4. A potential/Lyapunov function on `u = x+1` using both valuations.
